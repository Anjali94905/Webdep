    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create strong passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
      <li>Enable two-factor authentication on financial accounts</li>
      <li>Do not share sensitive information via email or messages</li>
      <li>Regularly monitor bank statements for suspicious activity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Cybercriminals often target financial data because it can be quickly
      exploited. Staying informed and cautious helps prevent identity theft
      and financial loss.
    </p>
    <h3>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</h3>
    <p>
      Strong passwords are the first line of defense for your financial accounts.
      Create passwords that are long and include a combination of uppercase and
      lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using personal
      information such as birthdays or names, and never reuse the same password
      across multiple accounts.
    </p>

    <h3>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
    <p>
      Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a
      second form of verification, such as a one-time code sent to your phone.
      Even if someone obtains your password, 2FA helps prevent unauthorized access
      to your account.
    </p>

    <h3>Watch Out for Phishing Scams</h3>
    <p>
      Phishing scams often appear as emails, text messages, or phone calls claiming
      to be from your bank. These messages may ask you to click a link or provide
      personal information. Banks will never request sensitive details like your
      password or PIN through email or text.
    </p>

    <h3>Keep Your Devices and Software Updated</h3>
    <p>
      Regular software updates help protect your devices from known security
      vulnerabilities. Always install updates for your operating system, browser,
      and banking apps to ensure you have the latest security protections.
    </p>

    <h3>Use Secure Internet Connections</h3>
    <p>
      Avoid accessing financial accounts using public Wi-Fi networks, as they can
      be insecure. When banking online, use a private and trusted internet
      connection to reduce the risk of data theft.
    </p>

    <h3>Monitor Your Accounts Regularly</h3>
    <p>
      Check your bank statements and transaction history frequently. If you notice
      any unusual or unauthorized activity, report it to your bank immediately.
      Early detection can help prevent further financial loss.
