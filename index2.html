      <h2>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</h2>
      <p>
        Strong passwords help protect your financial accounts from unauthorized
        access. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers,
        and symbols, and avoid reusing the same password across multiple sites.

      <h2>Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring
        a second form of verification, such as a one-time code sent to your
        phone, in addition to your password.

      <h2>Be Aware of Phishing Scams</h2>
      <p>
        Cybercriminals often use emails or messages pretending to be from banks.
        Never click suspicious links or share personal information. Banks will
        never ask for your password or PIN.

      <h2>Use Secure Internet Connections</h2>
      <p>
        Avoid accessing online banking on public Wi-Fi networks. Always use a
        trusted and secure internet connection to reduce the risk of data theft.

      <h2>Monitor Your Accounts Regularly</h2>
      <p>
        Regularly reviewing your bank statements and transaction history helps
        you identify suspicious activity early. Report anything unusual to
        your bank immediately.
